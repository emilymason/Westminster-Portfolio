I chose this lab for my portfolio because I think it is a fantastic example of the many things I learned in Computer Architecture. The whole class took my system level understanding of computers to a whole new level. I feel like I understand what is going on in my computer so much better now!

There were 5 experiments we had to do for this lab, the first one demonstrates the importance of using cache, the second demonstrates different mapping methods for caching, the third demonstrates the effect that fully-associative mapping has on cache, the fourth demonstrates the benefit of having multiple levels of cache, and the last demonstrates the costs of accessing memory in different orders.
