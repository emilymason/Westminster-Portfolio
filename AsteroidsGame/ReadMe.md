# Asteroids Game

This project was one of the coolest projects I've been able to work on. Given some skeleton code, we wrote a clone of the classic 1979 Asteroids game using inheritance and ArrayLists. This project was my first exposure to a more sophisticated way of writing code. I wasn't used to multi-file projects, or inheritance. Not only did I learn the importance of file structure, I was able to implement this idea when adding my own code. This is one of the projects that taught me the importance of the technique of software design. This project also helped me learn how to think about solving problems. Up until this point, our assignments had been pretty guided. There were always lots of instructions and hints for where you might get stuck. I remember this project as being one that needed a lot more thought put into it. From this, I was able to learn how to look at a problem from many different angles in order to find a solution when my first try didn't work.
