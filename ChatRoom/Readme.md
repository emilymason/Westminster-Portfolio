# Chat Room Application

I chose this project for my portfolio because it's one that I'm most proud of. The objective was to build an application that operates as follows: The server application listens to a specifiec port for client connections. The server keeps track of all client connections in the chat room. A client joins the chatroom according to their userneame. Once the client has connected to the server, the client may send a message to the chat room where it will be broadcast to all members. The application also required students to make a new protocol in groups. The link to the documentation for our protocol will be linked below.
 
This project gave me very valuable experience in two ways. The protocol creation process is the first way. We worked in groups of about 10 students to come up with one cohesive idea. It took quite a few class periods to get all of our ideas sorted out and to agree on what direction we wanted to take, but we ended up with a good protocol. The second valuable experience happened through the application development process. The subject of Computer Networks doesn't come easily to me, but through trial and error, I was able to create an application that worked! Since I ran into a lot of road blocks, this project helped me increase my problem solving and debugging skills. These are skills that I have used in almost every program that I've touched since then.
