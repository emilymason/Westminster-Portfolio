This project was made for my Software Engineering class. I chose it to include in my portfolio because I am really proud of the work that I did on it. We were put in groups of 3 or 4 and told to create a math game for 1st and 2nd grade students. We were given a list of requirements and the rest of the semester consisted of our groups working on our projects. My group decided to make a web application. My group members worked on configuring API Gateway in AWS and the HTML files. I worked on the Game Scripts and some of the CSS files.

This project really helped me learn the importance of collaboration and communication. My group had really good communication and collaboration from the start and that is part of why it went so smoothly. Had we not been communicating, it would have been very hard to integrate all of our parts. We also agreed to meet outside of class 2 times weekly for 2 hours to work on our parts together. It was a good experience because we had to have a good group effort, but also had to be individually reliable to get our parts done. This project also helped me understand what a software engineering job could really be like. We had to design our software, execute and test it, and then show it to our teacher for "customer feedback". I feel that going through this process will be very valuable as I move forward into the workforce.
